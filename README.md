This code repository holds the Deno and Arduino code for the rainwater distribution and recycling system designed in Fall 2024 by David Battiston, Chris Dowd, and William Vickers.

The goal is to be able to remotely operate and monitor recycled water usage via servo motors attached to valves. All of the projects proposed functions were met and are functioning as of Arduino IDE 2.3.4 and Deno 2.1.
